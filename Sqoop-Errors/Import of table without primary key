1. If we import a table using sqoop from mysql and if the table does not have a primary key, then it fails if the 
sqoop import command uses more than 1 mapper. This is because the boundary value condition which is run by default in the 
sqoop import command does not get a primary key and it is not able to divide the data between the number of mappers specified. 
To avoid the failure of such table --> use number of mappers as 1.
                       
                            -m 1    or
                            --num-mappers 1
                            
                            
                            
2. If we insert any value in the hive table using insert into command, the data is inserted on the top of the table, whereas in Impala,
the data is inserted at the bottom.
