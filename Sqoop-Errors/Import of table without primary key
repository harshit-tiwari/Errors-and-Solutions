#If we import a table using sqoop from mysql and if the table does not have a primary key, then it fails if the 
sqoop import command uses more than 1 mapper. This is because the boundary value condition which is run by default in the 
sqoop import command does not get a primary key and it is not able to divide the data between the number of mappers specified. 
To avoid the failure of such table --> use number of mappers as 1.
                       
                            -m 1    or
                            --num-mappers 1
