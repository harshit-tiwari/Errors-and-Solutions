When we shoot spark-submit command, we may get a warning message as below:

FAILED SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:4040: java.net.BindException: Address already in use

This warning is thrown when on port 4040 (which is by default Spark UI port) there is some service already running. 
However this does not stop the program running. The Spark UI then increments the default port to 
4041 automatically and starts the service there.

For my installation the default port number is http://192.168.1.9:4040

If the problem persists and the execution doesn't start at the next port then kill the service running at the default port.
Follow the below commands.

1. Check for the service running at the port 4040 or the port in your installation at which your UI is throwing a warning.
Command --> lsof -i:4040
This will display the following job statistics. This job is running at the port 4040.
    COMMAND  PID     USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
    java    6303 cloudera  546u  IPv4  45784      0t0  TCP *:yo-main (LISTEN)
    
2. Note down the PID from the above statistics. Now kill this job using the following command.
Command --> sudo kill -9 PID    eg.. sudo kill -9 6303

This kills the job running at the port. Now the spark job can be submitted and the above warning will not appear.
